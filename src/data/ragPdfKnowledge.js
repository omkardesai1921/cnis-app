      'Human energy requirements: Report of a Joint FAO/WHO/UNU Expert Consultation 2. PRINCIPLES AND DEFINITIONS Human energy requirements are estimated from measures of energy expenditure plus the additional energy needs for growth, pregnancy and lactation. Recommendations for dietary energy intake from food must satisfy these requirements for the attainment and maintenance of optimal health, physiological function and well-being. The latter (i.e. well-being) depends not only on health, but also on the ability to satisfy the demands imposed by society and the environment, as well as all the other energy-demanding activities that fulfil individual needs. Energy balance is achieved when input (i.e. dietary energy intake) is equal to output (i.e. total energy expenditure), plus the energy cost of growth in childhood and pregnancy, or the energy cost to produce milk during lactation. When energy balance is maintained over a prolonged period, an individual is considered to be in a steady state. This can include short periods during which the day- to-day balance between intake and expenditure does not occur. An optimal steady state is achieved when energy intake compensates for total energy expenditure and allows for adequate growth in children, and pregnancy and lactation in women, without imposing metabolic, physiological or behavioural restrictions that limit the full expression of a person’s biological, social and economic potential. Within certain limits, humans can adapt to transient or enduring changes in energy intake through possible physiological and behavioural responses related to energy expenditure and/or changes in growth. Energy balance is maintained, and a new steady state is then achieved. However, adjustments to low or high energy intakes may sometimes entail biological and behavioural penalties, such as reduced growth velocity, loss of lean body mass, excessive accumulation of body fat, increased risk of disease, forced rest periods, and physical or social limitations in performing certain activities and tasks. Some of these adjustments are important and may even increase the chances of survival in times of food scarcity. 2.1 DEFINITIONS An adequate, healthy diet must satisfy human needs for energy and all essential nutrients. Furthermore, dietary energy needs and recommendations cannot be considered in isolation of other nutrients in the diet, as the lack of one will influence the others. Thus, the following definitions are based on the assumption that requirements for energy will be fulfilled through the consumption of a diet that satisfies all nutrient needs. Energy requirement is the amount of food energy needed to balance energy expenditure in order to maintain body size, body composition and a level of necessary and desirable physical activity consistent with long-term good health. This includes the energy needed for the optimal growth and development of children, for the deposition of tissues during pregnancy, and for the secretion of milk during lactation consistent with the good health of mother and child. The recommended level of dietary energy intake for a population group is the mean energy requirement of the healthy, well-nourished individuals who constitute that group. Based on these definitions, a main objective for the assessment of energy requirements is the prescription of dietary energy intakes that are compatible with long-term good health. Therefore, the levels of energy intake recommended by this expert consultation are based on estimates of the requirements of healthy, well-nourished individuals. It is recognized that some populations have particular public health characteristics that are part of their usual, “normal” life. Foremost among these are population groups in many developing countries where there are numerous infants and children who suffer from mild to moderate degrees of malnutrition and who experience frequent episodes of infectious diseases, mostly diarrhoeal and respiratory infections. Special considerations are made in this report for such sub-populations. 4',
      'Energy requirements of children and adolescents It is therefore important that recommendations for appropriate levels of physical activity accompany recommendations for dietary energy intakes. There is no direct experimental or epidemiological evidence on the minimal or optimal frequency, duration and intensity of exercise that promotes health and well-being in children, but it has been suggested that children should perform a minimum of 60 minutes per day of moderate-intensity physical activity, which may be carried out in cumulative bouts of ten or more minutes, and which should be supplemented by activities that promote flexibility, muscle strength and increase in bone mass (Boreham and Riddoch, 2001). This can be pursued by promoting walking, climbing stairs or cycling as part of everyday activities, and encouraging participation in games and sports that involve body displacement and a certain degree of physical effort. In making such recommendations, local culture, social customs and environmental characteristics must be taken into account. 4.6 INFECTIONS AND MILD MALNUTRITION Nutritional requirements and dietary energy recommendations for children who are severely malnourished or chronically ill, such as owing to HIV/AIDS, are beyond the scope of this report. It must be recognized, however, that many populations around the world include large proportions of children with some degree of weight deficit and growth retardation as a result of mild to moderate chronic malnutrition and/or repeated bouts of infections (UNICEF, 2001). As was pointed out in the report from the 1985 FAO/WHO/UNU expert consultation (WHO, 1985), when a public health problem is of such magnitude that it affects the energy and protein requirements of a significant part of the population, it may not be ignored in the assessment of such requirements or in the recommendations that are made. Situations that promote malnutrition also favour a high incidence of infectious diseases, which in turn further contribute to the malnutrition. For many children under five – and particularly those under three – years of age who live in these conditions, being sick or convalescing from diarrhoea or a respiratory infection is part of “normal life”, because they experience this several times a year, with each episode lasting two to 15 days and requiring up to twice that time to achieve full recovery, provided that an intervening new episode of disease does not interrupt the recovery process (Mata, 1978; Black and Lanata, 1995; Steinhoff, 2000). Infections of this nature often result in negative energy balance resulting from poor appetite, decreased absorption of nutrients during diarrhoeal episodes and increased metabolic rate, particularly in febrile processes (Waterlow and Tomkins, 1992; Torun, 2000). This leads to chronic mild wasting (i.e. low weight-for-height) and stunting (i.e. low height-for-age), which may be prevented, ameliorated or corrected if adequate care and food are available, especially in the periods between infectious episodes when appetite has been re-established. If, on the contrary conditions do not improve, the status quo of mild malnutrition is maintained, the possibility for catch-up is reduced and the consequences of malnutrition will continue to prevail in those societies. Diets for catch-up weight gain must provide all nutrients and energy sources in amounts that surpass the requirements of well-nourished, healthy children. Quantitative estimates of energy requirements for catch-up are difficult to establish for two reasons: 1) the target body weight is not fixed but increases with time in a growing child, so that the longer the period of nutritional deficit, the greater the gap to be filled; and 2) a low weight for a given age may be owing either to a reduction in weight below the acceptable range of weight-for-height (i.e. wasting) or to a low height (i.e. stunting) with a concomitant decrease in weight. In the latter case, if the decrease in weight is proportional to the reduced growth in height, the child will not have a weight deficit as such, and provision of additional dietary energy may lead to overweight, as catch-up in height is much slower and less likely to be achieved than increase in weight. The extra amounts of energy needed for catch-up growth of a child with actual weight deficit (i.e. low weight-for-height) have been estimated in studies on the rehabilitation of malnourished children as 21 kJ (5 kcal) per gram of tissue to be laid down (Fomon, 1971; Ashworth, 1969; Kerr et al., 1973; Whitehead, 1973; Spady et al., 1976; Krieger and Whitten, 1976). The recommended daily amounts of energy will depend on the rate at which catch-up is expected to occur. Under optimal clinical conditions, children with severe malnutrition can gain weight at rates of up to 20 or more times faster than normal growth. However, at the community level, catch-up rates of free-living children with mild 31',

      'GOVERNMENT OF INDIA MINISTRY OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT LOK SABHA UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 1192 TO BE ANSWERED ON 09.02.2024 STUDY ON MALNUTRITION AMONG WOMEN AND CHILDREN 1192. SHRI SANJAY JADHAV: Will the Minister of Women and Child Development be pleased to state: (a) whether the Government has conducted any study or survey to find out the level of malnutrition among women and children across the country; (b) if so, the details and the outcome thereof; (c) the total number of malnourished children in the country and the number among them falling in the category of more severely malnourished; (d) if so, the details of malnourished children in the country, State/UT-wise; (e) the names of districts and States in which the number of malnourished children are maximum/minimum; and (f) the measures taken by the Government to deal with the problem of malnutrition among the children across the country? ANSWER MINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT (SHRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI) (a) to (f) The data on malnutrition among women and children is released under National Family Health Survey (NFHS), which is conducted by Ministry of Health & Family Welfare. The report of NFHS-5 is available on National Family Health Survey portal (http://rchiips.org/nfhs/factsheet_nfhs-5.shtml). As per the report released by the National Family Health Survey-5 (2019-21), 18.7% of Women of reproductive age group (15-49 years) have Body Mass Index (BMI) below normal (BMI <18.5 kg/ /m2) and 57% women of reproductive age group (15-49 years) are anaemic. The key interventions of MoHFW to improve maternal and child health, inter alia, are placed at Annexure-I. The indicators for malnutrition like underweight, stunting and wasting have shown a steady improvement in National Family Health Survey (NFHS) conducted by Ministry of Health & Family Welfare. As per the recent report of NFHS-5 (2019-21), the nutrition indicators for children under 5 years have improved as compared with NFHS-4 (2015-16). Stunting has reduced from 38.4% to 35.5%, while Wasting has reduced from 21.0% to 19.3% and Underweight prevalence has reduced from 35.8% to 32.1%. As per the data of Poshan Tracker for the month of December 2023, around 7.44 crore children under 6 years were measured, out of whom 36% were found to be',
      'stunted and 17% were found to be underweight and 6% children under 5 years were found to be wasted. The levels of underweight and wasting obtained from Poshan Tracker are much less than that projected by NFHS 5. Government reviews the performance/impact of scheme on regular basis. In addition, a third-party evaluation of all Centrally Sponsored Schemes in Women and Child Development Sector including Anganwadi services was conducted by NITI Aayog in 2020. The evaluation found the relevance of Anganwadi Services scheme satisfactory. In the 15th Finance Commission, components of nutritional support for children below the age of 6 years, pregnant women and lactating mother, Adolescent Girls (14 – 18 years); Early Childhood Care and Education [3-6 years]; Anganwadi infrastructure including modern, upgraded Saksham Anganwadi, POSHAN Abhiyaan and Scheme for Adolescent Girls have been reorganized under Mission Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 (Mission Poshan 2.0). Mission Poshan 2.0 focuses on Maternal Nutrition, Infant and Young Child Feeding Norms, Treatment of MAM/SAM and Wellness through AYUSH practices to reduce wasting and under-weight prevalence besides stunting and anemia. Under Mission Poshan 2.0, Supplementary nutrition is provided to beneficiaries 300 days in a year through the network of 13.97 lakh AWC located across the country for bridging the gap in the intake as compared to the recommended dietary intake. Only fortified rice is being supplied to AWCs to meet the requirement of micronutrient and control anaemia among women and children. Greater emphasis is being given on the use of millets for preparation of Hot Cooked Meal and Take Home rations (THR – not raw ration) at Anganwadi centers for Children below 6 years of age, Pregnant Women, Lactating Mothers. The objectives of Poshan 2.0 are as follows: ▪ To contribute to human capital development of the country; ▪ Address challenges of malnutrition; ▪ Promote nutrition awareness and good eating habits for sustainable health and well-being; and ▪ Address nutrition related deficiencies through key strategies. Steps have been taken to improve nutritional quality and testing in accredited labs, strengthen delivery and leverage technology under Poshan Tracker to improve governance. States/UTs have been advised to promote use of AYUSH systems for prevention of malnutrition and related diseases. A programme to support development of Poshan Vatikas at Anganwadi Centers to meet dietary diversity gap leveraging traditional knowledge in nutritional practices has also been taken up. Under Poshan 2.0, one of the major activities undertaken is Community Mobilization and Awareness Advocacy leading to Jan Andolan to educate the people on nutritional aspects. IEC materials in the form of videos, pamphlets, flyers etc., in regional languages have also been developed around critical themes. Social & Behavioral Changes have been inculcated through conducting Community Based Events, Poshan Maah and Poshan Pakhwada in convergence with various Ministries/',
      'Departments and other stakeholders. So far, more than 90 crore sensitization activities have been reported by States/ UTs under community engagements programmes through 11 Poshan Maahs and Poshan Pakhwadas celebrated in the months of September and March-April respectively. Community Based Events (CBEs) have served as a significant strategy in changing nutrition practices. CBEs help to celebrate critical milestones in the life of pregnant women and children below two years of age and to disseminate critical information on inter alia, right time to ensure appropriate complementary feeding with diet diversity. Close to 3.70 crore Community Based Events have been held so far. IT systems have been leveraged to strengthen and bring about transparency in nutrition delivery support systems at the Anganwadi centres. The ‘Poshan Tracker’ application was rolled out on 1st March, 2021 as an important governance tool. The Poshan Tracker facilitates monitoring and tracking of all AWCs, AWWs and beneficiaries on defined indicators. Technology under Poshan Tracker is being leveraged for dynamic identification of stunting, wasting, under-weight prevalence among children. Further, under Poshan 2.0, for the first time, a digital revolution was ushered in when the Anganwadi Centres were equipped with mobile devices. The mobile application has also facilitated digitization and automation of physical registers used by AWWs that helps in improving their quality of work. Poshan Tracker is available in 22 languages including Hindi and English. It has facilitated near real time data collection for Anganwadi Services such as, daily attendance, ECCE, Provision of Hot Cooked Meal (HCM)/Take Home Ration (THR-not raw ration), Growth Measurement etc. The App also offers counselling videos on key behaviours and services which help disseminate messages on birth preparedness, delivery, post-natal care, breastfeeding and complementary feeding. States/UTs can see their progress on various indicators on the Poshan Tracker dashboard on monthly basis and can make course correction wherever required. In addition, Ministry of Women & Child Development and Ministry of Health & Family Welfare jointly released the protocol for Community Management of Malnutrition (CMAM) to prevent and treat severe acute malnutrition children thereby reducing associated morbidity and mortality. The community-based approach involves timely detection and screening of children with severe acute malnutrition in the community, management for those without medical complications with wholesome, local nutritious foods at home and supportive medical care. Those malnourished children who have medical complications are referred for facility-based care. The States/UTs wise detail of malnourished children in the country is at Annexure-II. The detail of States with maximum and minimum malnourished children is at Annexure – III. The detail of districts with maximum and minimum malnourished children is at Annexure – IV. *****',

      'CURRENT DIET AND NUTRITION SCENARIO Health and nutrition are the most important contributory factors for human resource development in the country. India has been classified by the World Bank as a country with a lower middle income, with per capita GNP of US $ 996-39451. It ranks 160th in terms of human development among 209 countries. Among the Indian population, about 28% in the rural and 26% in the urban areas are estimated to be below the poverty line2, which is defined as the expenditure needed to obtain, on an average, 2400 Kcal per capita per day in the rural areas and 2100 Kcal in urban areas. Long-term malnutrition leads to stunting and wasting, non-communicable chronic diet related disorders, increased morbidity and mortality and reduced physical work output. It is a great economic loss to the country and undermines development. Common Nutrition Problems Protein Energy Malnutrition (PEM), micronutrient deficiencies such as vitamin A deficiency (VAD) , Iron Deficiency Anemia (IDA), Iodine Deficiency Disorders(IDD) and vitamin B-complex deficiencies are the nutrition problems frequently encountered, particularly among the rural poor and urban slum communities. Undernutrition starts as early as during conception. Because of extensive maternal undernutrition (underweight, poor weight gain during pregnancy, nutritional anaemia and vitamin deficiencies), about 22% of the infants are born with low birth-weight (<2500 g)3, as compared to less than 10% in the developed countries. Both clinical and sub-clinical undernutrition are widely prevalent even during early childhood and adolescence. Though the prevalence of florid forms of severe PEM like kwashiorkor and marasmus among preschool children is <1 %, national surveys indicate that about half of (48%) <5 year children suffer from sub- clinical undernutrition such as underweight (43%) stunting and wasting (20%) which indicates that undernutrition is of long duration3. The studies have shown that there is a steep increase in the prevalence of underweight with increase of age, from 27% at 6 months of age to a high of 45% at 24 months of age4. This is attributable to faulty infant and young child feeding practices prevailing in the community. Persistent undernutrition throughout the growing phase of childhood leads to short stature in adults. About 33% of adult men and 36% of the women have a Body Mass Index (BMI) [Weight in kg/(Height in meter)2] below 18.5, which indicates Chronic Energy Deficiency or CED (Table1)4. In the case of vitamin A deficiency, 0.8- 1% of preschool children show the signs of Bitot\'s spots and night blindness. Vitamin A deficiency also increases the risk of disease and death. 3',
      'Among children between the ages of 6 and 59 months, a majority (70%)3 are anemic. Nearly three fourth (75%) of women in India are anemic, with the prevalence of moderate to severe anemia being highest (50%) among pregnant women5. It is estimated that nutritional anemia contributes to about 24%6 of maternal deaths every year and is one of the important causes of low birth weight. It adversely affects work output among adults and learning ability in children. Iodine deficiency disorders (IDD) are very common among large sections of population in several parts of the country. About 167 million are estimated to be living in IDD endemic areas. Iodine deficiency causes goiter (enlargement of thyroid gland in the neck), neonatal hypothyroidism, cretinism among new borns, mental retardation, delayed motor development, stunting, deaf-mutism and neuromuscular disorders. The most important consequence of iodine deficiency in mothers is cretinism in which the children suffer from mental and growth retardation right from the birth. About 90,000 still-births and neonatal deaths occur every year due to maternal iodine deficiency. Around 54 million persons are estimated to have goiter, 2.2 million have cretinism and 6.6 million suffer from mild psycho-motor handicaps7. India is passing through the phase of economic transition and while the problem of undernutrition continues to be a major problem, prevalence of overnutrition is emerging as a significant problem, especially in the urban areas. The prevalence of overweight/ obesity is higher among the women (10.9%) compared to men (7.8%) in rural areas4. The prevalence of Diabetes Mellitus8 and Coronary Heart Disease (CHD)9 is also higher in urban areas as compared to their rural counterparts. The incidence rate of cancer is comparatively higher among women (123) compared to men (113 for 100,000)10. Food availability and consumption The overall production of food grains (cereals/millets/pulses) recorded a significant increase from about 108 million tones in 1970-71 to a little over 230 million tones during 2007-200811,12. Though the production of cereals and millets appears to be adequate, production of pulses, the source of protein for the rural poor, actually shows a decline. Total Production of vegetables is about 30% less than the demand of 100 million tones13. The total production of milk during 2006-2007 was about 100.9 million tones, corresponding to about 245 g per caput per day, which is lower than the world average of 285 g per day14. Though the per capita availability of various foods stuffs is comparable to RDA, the distribution of foods, both within the community and the family, may be unfavorable to some vulnerable groups due to low income and purchasing power. In view of the high cost of milk, a large proportion of the Indian population subsists on diets consisting mostly of plant foods with low nutrient bio-availability (Table 2). 5',
      'INTRODUCTION Nutrition is a basic human need and a prerequisite to a healthy life. A proper diet is essential from the very early stages of life for proper growth, development and to remain active. Food consumption, which largely depends on production and distribution, determines the health and nutritional status of the population. The recommended dietary allowances (RDA) are nutrient-centred and technical in nature. Apart from supplying nutrients, foods provide a host of other components (non-nutrient phytochemicals) which have a positive impact on health. Since people consume food, it is essential to advocate nutrition in terms of foods, rather than nutrients. Emphasis has, therefore, been shifted from a nutrient orientation to the food-based approach for attaining optimal nutritional status. Dietary guidelines are a translation of scientific knowledge on nutrients into specific dietary advice. They represent the recommended dietary allowances of nutrients in terms of diets that should be consumed by the population. The guidelines promote the concept of nutritionally adequate diets and healthy lifestyles from the time of conception to old age. Formulation of dietary goals and specific guidelines would help in providing required guidance to people in ensuring nutritional adequacy. The dietary guidelines could be directly applied for general population or specific physiological or high risk groups to derive health benefits. They may also be used by medical and health personnel, nutritionists and dietitians. The guidelines are consistent with the goals set in national policies on Agriculture, Health and Nutrition. The dietary guidelines ought to be practical, dynamic and flexible, based on the prevailing situation. Their utility is influenced by the extent to which they reflect the social, economic, agricultural and other environmental conditions. The guidelines can be considered as an integral component of the country\'s comprehensive plan to reach the goals specified in the National Nutrition Policy. The major food issues of concern are insufficient/ imbalanced intake of foods/nutrients. The common nutritional problems of public health importance in India are low birth weight, protein energy malnutrition in children, chronic energy deficiency in adults, micronutrient malnutrition and diet-related non- communicable diseases. However, diseases at the either end of the spectrum of',
      'Guideline 1 Eat variety of foods to ensure a balanced diet Rationale: Nutritionally adequate diet should be consumed through a wise choice from a variety of foods (cid:1)Nutrition is a basic prerequisite to sustain life. (cid:1)Variety in food is not only the spice of life but also the essence of nutrition and health. (cid:1)A diet consisting of foods from several food groups provides all the required nutrients in proper amounts. (cid:1)Cereals, millets and pulses are major sources of most nutrients. (cid:1)Milk which provides good quality proteins and calcium must be an essential item of the diet, particularly for infants, children and women. (cid:1)Oils and nuts are calorie-rich foods, and are useful for increasing the energy density and quality of food. (cid:1)Inclusion of eggs, flesh foods and fish enhances the quality of diet. However, vegetarians can derive almost all the nutrients from diets consisting of cereals, pulses, vegetables, fruits and milk-based diets. (cid:1)Vegetables and fruits provide protective substances such as vitamins/ minerals/ phytonutrients. (cid:1)Diversified diets with a judicious choice from a variety food groups provide the necessary nutrients. Why do we need nutritionally adequate food? Nutrients that we obtain through food have vital effects on physical growth and development, maintenance of normal body function, physical activity and health. Nutritious food is, thus needed to sustain life and activity. Our diet must provide all essential nutrients in the required amounts. Requirements of essential nutrients vary with age, gender, physiological status and physical activity. Dietary intakes lower or higher than the body requirements can lead to undernutrition (deficiency diseases) or overnutrition (diseases of affluence) respectively. Eating too little food during certain significant periods of life such as infancy, childhood, adolescence, pregnancy and lactation and eating too much at any age can lead to harmful consequences. An adequate diet, providing all nutrients, is needed throughout our lives. The nutrients must be obtained through a judicious choice and combination of a variety of foodstuffs from different food groups (Figure 1). 11',

      '230 Discussion same 5th centile for a 2-month interval at the same age (10 to 12 months) indicates a gain of about 30g (Table 6), implying that there was time for recovery within the longer interval. Alternative approaches to constructing conditional weight gain references Others have approached the construction of conditional weight gain references by applying methodologies that adjust not only for age but also for regression to the mean (Wright et al, 1994; Cole, 1995; Cole, 1997). The theoretical basis for this approach is the expectation that over time infant weights drift towards the median from the tails of the distribution. Using this approach, weight gain is calculated in terms of the change (compared with the initial measurement) in the infant\'s attained weight SD score adjusted for regression to the mean (Cole, 1995). The formula for this calculation hinges on the correlation between the initial and second SD scores, which determines the expected slope of the change in the child\'s size between the two points of measurement. Despite its theoretical advantages, calculation of this conditional gain SD score requires computerization and thus limits the potential for its application. In effect, this approach has not gained currency in clinical settings. To explore how conditional gain SD scores compare with the increment centiles presented in this report, the published methodology (Cole, 1995) was applied for adjusting for regression to the mean on 1- and 2-month interval weight increments (results are presented in Appendix C). The first step was to calculate the attained weight-for-age (WA) z-score for each child at each of the visits. Next, the respective correlation matrices for the 1- and 2-month intervals were derived. Then, the published formula to calculate SD (the z-score associated with the change in WA z-score between visits) was gain applied. The SD values were compared with z-scores of the age-conditioned 1- and 2-month weight gain increments. Plots of empirical densities showed that the distributions of the z-scores from the two methods overlap for each respective test interval (figures C1 and C2). Distributions of pairwise differences between the z-scores from the two methods were also examined (figures C3 and C4). Ninety percent of the differences were between -0.33 and +0.34 (for 1-month intervals) and between -0.27 and +0.29 (for 2-month intervals). To assess the magnitude of the impact of regression to the mean, two sets of children were selected: one in the lower bound (WA z-scores between -2.5 and -1.5) and the other in the upper bound (WA z-scores between +1.5 to +2.5) of attained growth at the start (time1) of specified intervals. The change in their z-scores at the end (time2) of 1- or 2-month periods were examined to observe what proportion deviated from the assumption of regression to the mean (Table C1). For the lower bound (time1 z-scores between -2.5 and -1.5), the results were consistent with regression to the mean only for initial ages 0-1 months and 0-2 months, i.e. WA drifted further from the median for 21% and 13% of children, respectively. For the remaining ages, 30-52% (1-month intervals) and 28-47% (2-month intervals) of weights shifted further from the mean, contrary to shifts that would have reflected regression to the mean. Similar findings were observed for the upper bound (time1 z- scores between +1.5 and +2.5) i.e. 27% (age 0-1 month) and 20% (age 0-2 months) drifted away from the mean. In the older age groups, this tendency was observed for 37-55% (1-month intervals) and 30-54% (2-month intervals). As expected, corresponding average changes in WA z-scores were, relatively high at ages 0-1 or 0-2 months (in the assumed direction of regression to the mean), but they dropped rapidly thereafter to near 0. In summary, growth in snapshots of 1- or 2-month intervals was consistent with regression to the mean between birth and 1 or 2 months but the phenomenon was much less evident at later ages. Differences between individual z-scores when applying the two methods were relatively minor. This',

      '2. METHODOLOGY 2.1 Design of the WHO Multicentre Growth Reference Study The MGRS (July 1997–December 2003) was a population-based study undertaken in Davis, California, USA; Muscat, Oman; Oslo, Norway; and Pelotas, Brazil; and in selected affluent neighbourhoods of Accra, Ghana and South Delhi, India. The MGRS protocol and its implementation in the six sites are described in detail elsewhere (de Onis et al., 2004a). Briefly, the MGRS combined a longitudinal component from birth to 24 months with a cross-sectional component of children aged 18–71 months. The longitudinal sample with visits planned at target ages allowed for the construction of growth velocity standards, which are the focus of this report. Mothers and newborns were screened and enrolled at birth and visited at home a total of 21 times on weeks 1, 2, 4 and 6; monthly from 2–12 months; and bimonthly in the second year. Data were collected on anthropometry, motor development, feeding practices, child morbidity, perinatal factors, and socioeconomic, demographic and environmental characteristics (de Onis et al., 2004b). The study populations lived in socioeconomic conditions favourable to growth where mobility was low, ≥20% of mothers followed WHO feeding recommendations and breastfeeding support was available (de Onis et al., 2004b). Individual inclusion criteria were: no known health or environmental constraints to growth; mothers willing to follow MGRS feeding recommendations (i.e. exclusive or predominant breastfeeding for at least 4 months, introduction of complementary foods by the age of 6 months, and continued partial breastfeeding up to at least 12 months); no maternal smoking before and after delivery; single term birth; and absence of significant morbidity (de Onis et al., 2004c). As part of the site-selection process in Ghana, India and Oman, surveys were conducted to identify socioeconomic characteristics that could be used to select groups whose growth was not environmentally constrained (Owusu et al., 2004; Bhandari et al., 2002; Mohamed et al., 2004). Local criteria for screening newborns, based on parental education and/or income levels, were developed from those surveys. Pre-existing survey data for this purpose were available from Brazil, Norway and the USA. The enrolment and baseline characteristics of the WHO Multicentre Growth Reference Study are described in detail elsewhere (WHO Multicentre Growth Reference Study Group, 2006c). Term low-birth-weight (<2500 g) infants (2.3%) were not excluded. Since it is likely that in well-off populations such infants represent small but normal children, their exclusion would have artificially distorted the standards’ lower centiles. 2.2 Anthropometry methods Data collection teams were trained at each site during the study\'s preparatory phase, at which time measurement techniques were standardized against one of two MGRS anthropometry experts. During the study, bimonthly standardization sessions were conducted at each site. Once a year, the anthropometry expert visited each site to participate in these sessions (de Onis et al., 2004c). Results from the anthropometry standardization sessions have been reported elsewhere (WHO Multicentre Growth Reference Study Group, 2006b). For the longitudinal component of the study, screening teams measured newborns within 24 hours of delivery, and follow-up teams conducted home visits until 24 months of age (de Onis et al., 2004b). The longitudinal component of the MGRS included data on weight, recumbent length (referred to subsequently as length) and head circumference, for which growth velocity standards are presented in this report. Observers working in pairs collected anthropometric data. Each observer independently measured and recorded a complete set of measurements, after which the two compared their readings. If any pair of readings exceeded the maximum allowable difference for a given variable (weight, 100 g; length, 7 mm; head circumference, 5 mm), both observers once again independently measured and recorded a second and, if necessary, a third set of readings for the variable(s) in question (de Onis et al., 2004b). - 5 -',

      'RECOMMENDATIONS #3  Two studies provided evidence on the efficacy of antibiotics in children managed as outpatients. In a retrospective analysis of children in Malawi with uncomplicated severe acute malnutrition managed as outpatients, outcomes in one cohort who received 7 days of oral amoxicillin in addition to ready-to-use therapeutic food were compared with those of a cohort who received ready-to-use therapeutic food only. At 12 weeks’ follow-up, mortality rates were less than 5% in both cohorts and rates of nutritional recovery were similar (56). However, these two cohorts of children were quite different at baseline and therefore the results are difficult to interpret. In a prospective, randomized, double-blind trial in southern Malawi, children with uncomplicated severe acute malnutrition managed as outpatients were randomized to receive either 1 week of amoxicillin 80–90 mg/kg/day, cefdinir 14 mg/kg/day or placebo (57). The rate of nutritional recovery of children who received antibiotics was significantly better than that of those who received placebo (amoxicillin 89.0%, cefdinir 91.4%, placebo 85.1%, P < 0.0002). This result was consistent among both children with bilateral oedema (amoxicillin 91.6%, cefdinir 92.9%, placebo 88.3%, P < 0.007) and those with severe wasting (amoxicillin78.9%, cefdinir 85.1%, placebo 73.7%, P < 0.03). Mortality rates were significantly lower in the groups that received antibiotics (amoxicillin 4.63%, cefdinir 3.86%, placebo 7.48%, P < 0.002). When analysed by type of malnutrition, mortality was reduced in children who had bilateral oedema (amoxicillin 3.49%, cefdinir 3.56%, placebo 7.48%, P < 0.0006). However, the study was not specifically powered to undertake the latter analysis. One before-and-after study of ampicillin and gentamicin as second-line antibiotics was also identi- fied. The design of the study was such that it was not possible to estimate the relative effect of the introduction of the antibiotic regimen independently of an algorithm for managing hypoglycaemia that was introduced in parallel (58). No studies of ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin or co-trimoxazole as a first-line treatment for children with severe acute malnutrition were identified. The overall quality of this evidence was rated as low, owing to methodological and reporting bias. See Annex 1, Table 1 for details of the GRADE assessment of the evidence. Discussion n The guideline group considered that the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics such as amoxicillin for children with severe acute malnutrition is supported by epidemiological data demonstrating a high prevalence of infections in these children, including children with uncomplicated severe acute malnutrition receiving outpatient management. n It is possible that providing antibiotics will result in some adverse events such as diarrhoea, skin reactions and hypersensitivities. However, it is unlikely that the frequency of such complications will be significantly more than in well-nourished children. n However, it was noted that the one randomized trial that specifically examined outcomes in this population was in a setting where the pattern of severe acute malnutrition is predominantly oedematous and HIV is also prevalent. n Increased antimicrobial resistance is a potential consequence of prescribing broad-spectrum antibiotics for the outpatient treatment of children with severe acute malnutrition. — However, children with severe acute malnutrition are at high risk of mortality – higher for example, than infants with fast breathing, where antibiotics are also currently recommended. — The reported reduction in mortality in children with uncomplicated severe acute malnutri- tion treated with antibiotics as outpatients (7.48% to 4.63%) is significant and the guideline group thought it was justified to recommend this intervention to this population, even at the risk of increasing antimicrobial resistance in the community. 27',
      ' GUIDELINE: UPDATES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE ACUTE MALNUTRITION IN INFANTS AND CHILDREN No randomized studies were identified that compared the outcomes of nutritional rehabilitation of children with severe acute malnutrition admitted on the basis of mid-upper arm circumference versus weight-for-height Z-score. Only one study compared the mortality risk of hospitalized children according to their mid-upper arm circumference versus their weight-for-height Z-score (32). The mortality risk was similar for children presenting with a weight-for-height ≤–3 Z-score or with a mid-upper arm circumference ≤115 mm, i.e. 10.1% and 10.9%, respectively. The highest risk for mortality (25.4%) was observed in children who had both weight-for-height ≤–3 Z-score or a mid-upper arm circumference ≤115 mm. Children with a mid-upper arm circumference ≤115 mm presented more frequently with signs of recent or current oedematous malnutrition, stunting and subcostal indrawing, and were more frequently girls and of younger age than those admitted with a weight-for-height ≤−3 Z-score (32). Bipedal oedema was present in 38.0% of children with a low mid-upper arm circumference versus 13.9% in those with a weight-for-height ≤−3 Z-score. Four studies, including an unpublished report, reported on outcomes of children diagnosed on the basis of mid-upper arm circumference only and managed in outpatient care without a comparison group admitted on the basis of weight-for-height (25, 28, 29, 33). The mortality risk for children with severe acute malnutrition was reported in three of the studies and was overall relatively low (≤2.1 %). The median recovery times ranged from 44.4 ± 29.7 days (33) to 50.5 ± 25.8 days (28). The daily gain of mid-upper arm circumference ranged from 0.17 ± 0.16 mm in children admitted with a mid-upper arm circumference <110 mm and treated in a supplementary feeding programme (25) to 0.51 ± 0.3 mm in Burkina Faso in children with a mid-upper arm circumference ≤110 mm and receiving ready-to-use therapeutic food (28). Two of the studies stratified the results by level of mid-upper arm circumference at admission (28, 29). In both studies, children admitted with a lower mid-upper arm circumference displayed a greater daily gain in weight and mid-upper arm circumference. Furthermore, in Burkina Faso, mortality was greater among children with a lower mid-upper arm circumference at admission and referral for inpatient care was more common. This latter study also reported that the daily gain in mid-upper arm circumference was higher in older and taller children, and in boys (28). Six additional studies also reported on gain in mid-upper arm circumference during nutritional rehabilitation, but admission was based on a weight-for-height Z-score of <–3. The daily gain in mid- upper arm circumference was in the same range as in studies that admitted children on the basis of a low mid-upper arm circumference only. Overall, mid-upper arm circumference increased by 0.2 to 0.4 mm/day during rehabilitation, with no obvious differences among studies admitting children on the basis of mid-upper arm circumference or weight-for-height. In all studies, the increase in mid- upper arm circumference paralleled the daily weight gain, which ranged between 3.0 and 6.5 g/kg. Two observational studies reported outcomes when mid-upper arm circumference was used as a discharge criterion for malnourished children from nutritional rehabilitation programmes (28, 29). In Burkina Faso, the time to discharge of children with mid-upper arm circumference <120 mm from an outpatient programme (n = 5689) was reported for the period April to December 2008 when discharge was based on 15% weight gain, and then for the period April to December 2009 when discharge was based on achieving mid-upper arm circumference ≥124 mm (without consideration of weight gain). When 15% weight gain was used as the discharge criterion, the mean time to discharge of children was 53 ± 25 days; in the later period when discharge was based on achieving a mid-upper arm circumference ≥124 mm, children were discharged after an average duration of 36 ± 20 days. In children whose mid-upper arm circumference was initially ≤114 mm, the average duration of treatment to achieve at least 15% weight gain was 48 ± 23 days, whereas for children whose mid- upper arm circumference was initially between 115 mm and 119 mm, the average duration of treatment was 55 ± 26 days. In contrast, when mid-upper arm circumference ≥124 mm was used as the discharge criterion, the average duration of treatment for the more malnourished children 16',

      'etc. Iodine deficiency during childhood, the period of maximum growth, can result in loss of I.Q. points and poor physical and mental growth and development. Although, on an average, prevalence of total goitre among 6-12 year old children is about 4%, it is 12.2% in Maharashtra and 9% in West Bengal which is much above the WHO cut off level of 5.0%. No State in the country is free from Iodine Deficiency Disorders (IDD). 260 districts out of 321 districts surveyed have more than 10% prevalence of IDD. High levels of malnutrition particularly among growing children are directly and indirectly associated with high morbidity and mortality. Iron deficiency in school-going children affects their learning ability and concentration power. Even mild deficiencies of micronutrients (vitamin A, iron, folic acid, zinc etc.) affect their growth, development and immunity. Malnourished children tend to have lower I.Q. and impaired cognitive ability which affects their school performance and productivity in later life. *** 36',

      'EXECUTIVE SUMMARY » 23 This agenda is driven by two imperatives. First, children have unique nutritional needs and can suffer unique harm from malnu- trition. Putting children’s needs first is key to ensuring that every child and young person has the nutrition they need to get the best start in life. Second, all children and young people will need nutritious, affordable and sustainable diets if societies are to meet the economic, social and environmental challenges of our changing world in the 21st century. 1 in 3 children For every child is not growing well to grow well 1 | Empower families, children and young people to demand nutritious food Demand affects supply as food producers respond to consumers’ behaviours and aspirations.

      '1. Introduction In 2015, United Nations (UN) Member States adopted the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which include a target to end all forms of malnutrition by 2030 (Target 2.2), including by achieving internationally agreed targets on wasting in infants and children under 5 years of age by 2025 (indicator 2.2.2) (2). This aligns with Global Nutrition Targets 2025 (3) and targets set by the 65th World Health Assembly (4) to reduce the prevalence of wasting in infants and children to below 5% by 2025 and below 3% by 2030. However, there has been little progress globally in reducing the prevalence of wasting since these major commitments were made. The 2023 Joint Child Malnutrition Estimates (5) by the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), WHO and the World Bank highlighted the huge burden of wasting and the fact that it is not declining. Relatively small improvements have been made in other nutrition targets such as stunting reduction, but progress in wasting has not followed the same trajectory. According to the Joint Child Malnutrition Estimates (5), 45 million infants and children under 5 experienced wasting in 2022; an estimated 13.7 million infants and children under 5 had severe wasting and the remainder had moderate wasting. However, UN agencies have stated that these are likely underestimations. There are also many more infants and children with nutritional oedema who are not captured in these estimates. There are serious consequences of wasting and nutritional oedema, including immediate susceptibility to disease and mortality. Surviving infants and children commonly experience poor motor and cognitive development, along with reduced economic productivity and elevated risk of non-communicable disease in adulthood. The Principals of the UN agencies who are involved in preventing and treating wasting and nutritional oedema in infants and children – the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the UN Refugee Agency, UNICEF, World Food Programme and WHO – released a joint statement (6) for urgent action to address wasting and nutritional oedema in 2019 and subsequently a framework for the Global Action Plan on Child Wasting (7). At the start of 2023, the Principals launched a Call To Action (8) to protect infants and children at risk of and experiencing wasting and nutritional oedema in 15 countries suffering from the most extreme effects of the ongoing food and nutrition crisis. As part of the Global Action Plan on Child Wasting, WHO committed to updating normative guidance for the prevention and management of wasting and nutritional oedema in infants and children. WHO also pledged to support the review and update of national guidelines and to oversee future research and policy efforts related to wasting and nutritional oedema under the UN Decade of Action on Nutrition (2016–2025) (9). The WHO Guideline: updates on the management of severe acute malnutrition in infants and children, 2013 (10) was released a decade ago in 2013 and included recommendations for infants and children with severe wasting and/or nutritional oedema. This new 2023 guideline builds on these past recommendations and aims to further enhance care of infants and children with severe wasting and nutritional oedema as these conditions contribute greatly to mortality and other negative outcomes. The 2023 guideline has also been expanded in scope to address some of the biggest nutritional challenges today, including providing support and interventions to mothers/caregivers, and infants less than 6 months old who are at risk of poor growth and development, even if they do not yet have wasting or nutritional oedema; managing moderate wasting in infants and children through dietary and clinical approaches; and mechanisms and programmes to prevent wasting across contexts. It also provides guidance on psychosocial elements of care for infants at risk of poor growth and development and infants and children with wasting and/or nutritional oedema, as well as their mothers/caregivers. 2 WHO guideline on the prevention and management of wasting and nutritional oedema in infants and children under 5 years',

      'WHO applied rigorous and high-quality methods for evidence synthesis and guideline development, which have advanced since the previous guideline, to inform the development of recommendations and good practice statements. However, one of the most important conclusions of the guideline development process is that much more evidence needs to be generated to inform how best to prevent and manage wasting and nutritional oedema. This guideline will therefore be responsive and data-driven, with further updates as evidence is available. A Technical Advisory Group will be involved to determine when new recommendations can be made; this process is described further in section 6.4 Updating recommendations. The release of this new guideline is a milestone in the fight against wasting and nutritional oedema. Yet there is much more to be done from here to promote survival, growth and development in infants and children globally who are at highest risk. 1.1 Purpose This new 2023 WHO guideline provides global evidence-informed recommendations and good practice statements on the prevention and management of wasting and nutritional oedema in infants and children. It aims to help WHO Member States and their partners to make evidence-informed decisions on the appropriate actions that should be taken in their efforts to prevent and manage wasting and nutritional oedema in infants and children. The recommendations and good practice statements are intended to inform, revise, or update the development of national or organizational guidelines, protocols, tools, and manuals. 1.2 Scope This 2023 guideline builds on the recommendations in the WHO Guideline: updates on the management of severe acute malnutrition in infants and children, 2013 (10) for severe wasting and/or nutritional oedema from a child health perspective. The 2013 guideline update covered eight broad topics on the identification and treatment of severe wasting and/or nutritional oedema in infants and children 6–59 months and included a limited number of recommendations for infants less than 6 months of age with severe wasting and/or nutritional oedema. The new guideline also has new recommendations and good practice statements for three new areas of focus, including infants less than 6 months of age at risk of poor growth and development (within which infants with wasting and/or nutritional oedema are a subset); moderate wasting in infants and children 6–59 months of age and prevention of wasting and nutritional oedema, depicted in Fig. 1.

      'Chapter 4: Findings and recommendations of the 2011 FAO Expert Consultation on Protein Quality Evaluation in Human Nutrition 21 For regulatory purposes two scoring patterns are recommended: the amino acid composition of human milk for infant formulas, and for all other foods and population groups the pattern for young children (6 months to 3 y) as noted in Table 5. The ratio should be calculated for each dietary indispensable amino acid and the lowest value designated as the DIAAS and used as an indicator of dietary protein quality. The DIAAS can have values below or in some circumstances above 100%. Values above 100% should not be truncated as was done for the PDCAAS value, except where calculating DIAAS for protein or amino acid intakes for mixed diets or sole source foods (see below) where truncated values must be used. Examples of calculations are shown for single food and multiple ingredient dishes and diets in Section 2 of the report. Practical application of the DIAAS There are three distinct uses of the DIAAS: • Calculation of DIAAS in mixed diets for meeting the needs for quality protein, as humans consume proteins from varied protein sources in mixed diets. • To document the additional benefit of individual protein sources with higher scores in complementing less nutritious proteins. • For regulatory purposes to classify and monitor the protein adequacy of foods and food products sold to consumers. When examining the quality of protein in mixed diets or in sole source foods (e.g., infant formulas) the DIAAS is used to estimate the available protein intake and the DIAAS can be used to adjust dietary protein intakes to meet requirements, (i.e. safe intake of any diet in relation to protein = safe protein requirement/DIAAS value of diet). In this case a DIAAS value >100% should never be used, since this would mean that for “high quality” diets based on egg or milk for example, for which the DIAAS values of the proteins individually may exceed 100%, the safe intake of that diet would be lower than the safe requirement level even though the safe requirement level may have been established with egg or milk in the first place. When examining protein intakes of mixed diets or sole source foods (e.g., infant formulas) the DIAAS and protein content can be used to estimate the available protein intake. DIAAS can be used as a means of defining protein equivalent intake (protein adequacy), when it is multiplied by the actual protein content or intake (i.e. measured protein intake times DIAAS). However, protein intake can be corrected for its quality by using DIAAS only when ≤100 but',
      'Chapter 4: Findings and recommendations of the 2011 FAO Expert Consultation on Protein Quality Evaluation in Human Nutrition 43 For the purpose of Codex, a quality assessment needs to be applied to protein claims. DIAAS is recommended for such protein quality assessment and should be given in conjunction with the protein quantity value. Substitute foods should not have DIAAS lower than the scores for the equivalent real food. Statement: the protein content of the food should be declared as determined by an appropriate analytical method and the quality determined by the DIAAS. For making a protein content claim the protein content should be determined analytically and evaluated for quality using DIAAS. The nutrient reference value (NRV) for protein recommended for labelling purposes in the interests of international standardization and harmonization is 50 g. To qualify for the nutrition claim: “source” for protein, a food must meet the following criteria: 10% of NRV per 100 g (solids); 5% of NRV per 100 ml (liquids); or 5% of NRV per 100 kcal (12% of NRV per 1 MJ); or 10% of NRV per serving. To qualify for: “High” for protein, the food must contain two times the values for “source”. When a food meets the criteria for protein quantity, then a quality measure should be applied. A comparison table for foods should be prepared to establish cut off values for nutrition claims for “source” and “high”. DIAAS cut-off values are needed to distinguish between excellent/high (e.g. 100 or more), good/source (e.g. 75-99), and no claim. It is recommended that no nutrition claim should be allowed to be made for source/high protein for proteins with DIAAS less than a certain cut-off (e.g. 75). In assessing the quality of proteins, quality cannot be substituted for quantity. An example of how these DIAAS cut-off values may be applied is given in Table 6. The actual values for the DIAAS cut-off points in the context of making claims requires careful further consideration (e.g. in relation to national and local dietary patterns). It is recommended that a “quality” statement related to protein (e.g., source of quality protein) be allowed. When calculating the DIAAS of new formulations of foods supplemented with crystalline amino acids, DIAAS should be confirmed by biological testing.',
      'Chapter 4: Findings and recommendations of the 2011 FAO Expert Consultation on Protein Quality Evaluation in Human Nutrition 39 discriminatory power (Millward et al., 1989) and resulted in unrealistically low efficiencies of utilisation (shallow slopes) because of an inappropriate analytical model which fails to take into account the adaptive nature of the metabolic demand (Millward, 2003; 2012a). While long term feeding trials based on body composition and maintenance of fitness have been used to assess protein quality of specific foods such as wheat (Bolourchi et al., 1968; Edwards et al., 1971), such feeding trials are expensive and logistically difficult to undertake and few have been reported. The diurnal nature of human feeding does involve post-prandial net protein synthesis to replace post absorptive losses and the efficiency of postprandial protein utilisation can be studied. This, to some extent, can be used as a measure of protein quality in humans. Several groups have developed stable isotope tracer studies to do this. Postprandial protein utilization (PPU) As discussed by Millward and Pacy (1995) postprandial protein utilisation is influenced by both dietary energy intake and by the quality of the protein in terms of its ability to meet the metabolic demand. This means that measurement of acute changes in 13C-1 leucine balance during the transition from a low to high protein intake during a 13C-1 leucine infusion indicates the efficiency of postprandial protein utilisation (PPU). Values obtained in this way are more realistic than those obtained from the slope of nitrogen balance studies which underestimate protein utilisation (Millward, 2003; Millward, 2012a). This approach has been used to compare milk and wheat protein utilisation in normal adults at their habitual levels of protein intake showing that the PPU of milk and wheat protein were 1.00 and 0.68 in a multiple small meal protocol (Millward et al., 2000b) and 0.93 and 0.61 in a single large meal protocol (Millward et al., 2002). In each case the wheat protein was better utilised than was predicted from its lysine content relative to human tissue protein lysine content possibly through reutilisation of the lysine liberated in the postabsorptive state for postprandial protein deposition. While such studies help to understand utilisation of highly digestible proteins they would be less able to entirely evaluate poorly digestible dietary protein sources. Net postprandial protein utilization (NPPU) [15N]-labelled proteins (milk, soya protein isolate, wheat and meat) have been used to measure the metabolic fate of dietary nitrogen after its consumption in humans. NPPU is calculated using true ileal digestibility and 15N-labelled protein utilization parameters (Tomé and Bos, 2000). Intrinsic labelling of dietary proteins with 15N allows the investigation of postprandial N transfers into different metabolic pools. Ileal digesta, blood and urine are sampled. The kinetics of dietary N appearance in ileal effluent, plasma proteins, plasma free amino acids, body urea, urinary urea and urinary ammonia are calculated using a 13-compartment, 21 parameter model (Juillet et al., 2006). NPPU values determined for milk, soya protein isolate and wheat were 81%, 78% and 66%, respectively (Bos et al., 1999; Tomé and Bos, 2000; Mariotti et al., 1999; Bos et al., 2005). This approach also',
      '28 Dietary protein quality evaluation in human nutrition: Report of an FAO Expert Consultation Breast milk pattern The amino acid composition of human milk has been used as a reference pattern to define the amino acid scores for infant foods (FAO/WHO/UNU, 2007). The metabolic demand for amino acids of the new born infant is not known with any certainty and the pattern of amino acids in human milk is not necessarily the same as the pattern of amino acid requirements. In fact amino acid intakes from breast milk are likely to be in excess of the actual demand for two reasons. Firstly as discussed in the FAO/WHO/UNU (2007) report, various calculations of the likely demand for amino acids by the new born infant indicate values that are lower than intakes from breast milk (Dewey et al., 1996). Indeed the values for individual amino acids in the requirement pattern at 6 months, calculated by FAO/WHO/UNU (2007) on the basis of a maintenance and growth factorial model, are on average 30% lower. Secondly the true ileal digestibility of breast milk amino acids in the human infant may be less than 100%. Actual values are not known although studies using bottle-fed piglets as a model for the human infant have shown values for the digestibility of amino acids in human milk ranging from 81–100 % (Darragh and Moughan, 1998). Nevertheless, because intakes of breast milk from a healthy well- nourished mother are considered to satisfy protein requirements for the first 6 months of life, the amino acid content of breast milk is recommended as the current best estimate of amino acid requirements for this age group. The amounts of amino acids in human breast milk corrected for the true ileal digestibility of amino acids in human breast milk may provide useful information on the pattern of amino acids required by the infant. Table 4. Dietary indispensable amino The amounts of each of the dietary indispensable acid profile of human milk1 amino acids in human milk, shown in table 4 are those listed by FAO/WHO/UNU (2007) (which derive from Amino acid* (mg/g total protein) reports published by Heine et al., 1991, Davis et al., His 21 1994, and Villalpando et al., 1998.)

      'CURRENT DIET AND NUTRITION SCENARIO Health and nutrition are the most important contributory factors for human resource development in the country. India has been classified by the World Bank as a country with a lower middle income, with per capita GNP of US $ 996-39451. It ranks 160th in terms of human development among 209 countries. Among the Indian population, about 28% in the rural and 26% in the urban areas are estimated to be below the poverty line2, which is defined as the expenditure needed to obtain, on an average, 2400 Kcal per capita per day in the rural areas and 2100 Kcal in urban areas. Long-term malnutrition leads to stunting and wasting, non-communicable chronic diet related disorders, increased morbidity and mortality and reduced physical work output. It is a great economic loss to the country and undermines development. Common Nutrition Problems Protein Energy Malnutrition (PEM), micronutrient deficiencies such as vitamin A deficiency (VAD) , Iron Deficiency Anemia (IDA), Iodine Deficiency Disorders(IDD) and vitamin B-complex deficiencies are the nutrition problems frequently encountered, particularly among the rural poor and urban slum communities. Undernutrition starts as early as during conception. Because of extensive maternal undernutrition (underweight, poor weight gain during pregnancy, nutritional anaemia and vitamin deficiencies), about 22% of the infants are born with low birth-weight (<2500 g)3, as compared to less than 10% in the developed countries. Both clinical and sub-clinical undernutrition are widely prevalent even during early childhood and adolescence. Though the prevalence of florid forms of severe PEM like kwashiorkor and marasmus among preschool children is <1 %, national surveys indicate that about half of (48%) <5 year children suffer from sub- clinical undernutrition such as underweight (43%) stunting and wasting (20%) which indicates that undernutrition is of long duration3. The studies have shown that there is a steep increase in the prevalence of underweight with increase of age, from 27% at 6 months of age to a high of 45% at 24 months of age4. This is attributable to faulty infant and young child feeding practices prevailing in the community. Persistent undernutrition throughout the growing phase of childhood leads to short stature in adults. About 33% of adult men and 36% of the women have a Body Mass Index (BMI) [Weight in kg/(Height in meter)2] below 18.5, which indicates Chronic Energy Deficiency or CED (Table1)4. In the case of vitamin A deficiency, 0.8- 1% of preschool children show the signs of Bitot\'s spots and night blindness. Vitamin A deficiency also increases the risk of disease and death. 3',
      'Among children between the ages of 6 and 59 months, a majority (70%)3 are anemic. Nearly three fourth (75%) of women in India are anemic, with the prevalence of moderate to severe anemia being highest (50%) among pregnant women5. It is estimated that nutritional anemia contributes to about 24%6 of maternal deaths every year and is one of the important causes of low birth weight. It adversely affects work output among adults and learning ability in children. Iodine deficiency disorders (IDD) are very common among large sections of population in several parts of the country. About 167 million are estimated to be living in IDD endemic areas. Iodine deficiency causes goiter (enlargement of thyroid gland in the neck), neonatal hypothyroidism, cretinism among new borns, mental retardation, delayed motor development, stunting, deaf-mutism and neuromuscular disorders. The most important consequence of iodine deficiency in mothers is cretinism in which the children suffer from mental and growth retardation right from the birth. About 90,000 still-births and neonatal deaths occur every year due to maternal iodine deficiency. Around 54 million persons are estimated to have goiter, 2.2 million have cretinism and 6.6 million suffer from mild psycho-motor handicaps7. India is passing through the phase of economic transition and while the problem of undernutrition continues to be a major problem, prevalence of overnutrition is emerging as a significant problem, especially in the urban areas. The prevalence of overweight/ obesity is higher among the women (10.9%) compared to men (7.8%) in rural areas4. The prevalence of Diabetes Mellitus8 and Coronary Heart Disease (CHD)9 is also higher in urban areas as compared to their rural counterparts. The incidence rate of cancer is comparatively higher among women (123) compared to men (113 for 100,000)10. Food availability and consumption The overall production of food grains (cereals/millets/pulses) recorded a significant increase from about 108 million tones in 1970-71 to a little over 230 million tones during 2007-200811,12. Though the production of cereals and millets appears to be adequate, production of pulses, the source of protein for the rural poor, actually shows a decline. Total Production of vegetables is about 30% less than the demand of 100 million tones13. The total production of milk during 2006-2007 was about 100.9 million tones, corresponding to about 245 g per caput per day, which is lower than the world average of 285 g per day14. Though the per capita availability of various foods stuffs is comparable to RDA, the distribution of foods, both within the community and the family, may be unfavorable to some vulnerable groups due to low income and purchasing power. In view of the high cost of milk, a large proportion of the Indian population subsists on diets consisting mostly of plant foods with low nutrient bio-availability (Table 2). 5',
      'INTRODUCTION Nutrition is a basic human need and a prerequisite to a healthy life. A proper diet is essential from the very early stages of life for proper growth, development and to remain active. Food consumption, which largely depends on production and distribution, determines the health and nutritional status of the population. The recommended dietary allowances (RDA) are nutrient-centred and technical in nature. Apart from supplying nutrients, foods provide a host of other components (non-nutrient phytochemicals) which have a positive impact on health. Since people consume food, it is essential to advocate nutrition in terms of foods, rather than nutrients. Emphasis has, therefore, been shifted from a nutrient orientation to the food-based approach for attaining optimal nutritional status. Dietary guidelines are a translation of scientific knowledge on nutrients into specific dietary advice. They represent the recommended dietary allowances of nutrients in terms of diets that should be consumed by the population. The guidelines promote the concept of nutritionally adequate diets and healthy lifestyles from the time of conception to old age. Formulation of dietary goals and specific guidelines would help in providing required guidance to people in ensuring nutritional adequacy. The dietary guidelines could be directly applied for general population or specific physiological or high risk groups to derive health benefits. They may also be used by medical and health personnel, nutritionists and dietitians. The guidelines are consistent with the goals set in national policies on Agriculture, Health and Nutrition. The dietary guidelines ought to be practical, dynamic and flexible, based on the prevailing situation. Their utility is influenced by the extent to which they reflect the social, economic, agricultural and other environmental conditions. The guidelines can be considered as an integral component of the country\'s comprehensive plan to reach the goals specified in the National Nutrition Policy. The major food issues of concern are insufficient/ imbalanced intake of foods/nutrients. The common nutritional problems of public health importance in India are low birth weight, protein energy malnutrition in children, chronic energy deficiency in adults, micronutrient malnutrition and diet-related non- communicable diseases. However, diseases at the either end of the spectrum of',
      'Guideline 1 Eat variety of foods to ensure a balanced diet Rationale: Nutritionally adequate diet should be consumed through a wise choice from a variety of foods (cid:1)Nutrition is a basic prerequisite to sustain life. (cid:1)Variety in food is not only the spice of life but also the essence of nutrition and health. (cid:1)A diet consisting of foods from several food groups provides all the required nutrients in proper amounts. (cid:1)Cereals, millets and pulses are major sources of most nutrients. (cid:1)Milk which provides good quality proteins and calcium must be an essential item of the diet, particularly for infants, children and women. (cid:1)Oils and nuts are calorie-rich foods, and are useful for increasing the energy density and quality of food. (cid:1)Inclusion of eggs, flesh foods and fish enhances the quality of diet. However, vegetarians can derive almost all the nutrients from diets consisting of cereals, pulses, vegetables, fruits and milk-based diets. (cid:1)Vegetables and fruits provide protective substances such as vitamins/ minerals/ phytonutrients. (cid:1)Diversified diets with a judicious choice from a variety food groups provide the necessary nutrients. Why do we need nutritionally adequate food? Nutrients that we obtain through food have vital effects on physical growth and development, maintenance of normal body function, physical activity and health. Nutritious food is, thus needed to sustain life and activity. Our diet must provide all essential nutrients in the required amounts. Requirements of essential nutrients vary with age, gender, physiological status and physical activity. Dietary intakes lower or higher than the body requirements can lead to undernutrition (deficiency diseases) or overnutrition (diseases of affluence) respectively. Eating too little food during certain significant periods of life such as infancy, childhood, adolescence, pregnancy and lactation and eating too much at any age can lead to harmful consequences. An adequate diet, providing all nutrients, is needed throughout our lives. The nutrients must be obtained through a judicious choice and combination of a variety of foodstuffs from different food groups (Figure 1). 11',

      '230 Discussion same 5th centile for a 2-month interval at the same age (10 to 12 months) indicates a gain of about 30g (Table 6), implying that there was time for recovery within the longer interval. Alternative approaches to constructing conditional weight gain references Others have approached the construction of conditional weight gain references by applying methodologies that adjust not only for age but also for regression to the mean (Wright et al, 1994; Cole, 1995; Cole, 1997). The theoretical basis for this approach is the expectation that over time infant weights drift towards the median from the tails of the distribution. Using this approach, weight gain is calculated in terms of the change (compared with the initial measurement) in the infant\'s attained weight SD score adjusted for regression to the mean (Cole, 1995). The formula for this calculation hinges on the correlation between the initial and second SD scores, which determines the expected slope of the change in the child\'s size between the two points of measurement. Despite its theoretical advantages, calculation of this conditional gain SD score requires computerization and thus limits the potential for its application. In effect, this approach has not gained currency in clinical settings. To explore how conditional gain SD scores compare with the increment centiles presented in this report, the published methodology (Cole, 1995) was applied for adjusting for regression to the mean on 1- and 2-month interval weight increments (results are presented in Appendix C). The first step was to calculate the attained weight-for-age (WA) z-score for each child at each of the visits. Next, the respective correlation matrices for the 1- and 2-month intervals were derived. Then, the published formula to calculate SD (the z-score associated with the change in WA z-score between visits) was gain applied. The SD values were compared with z-scores of the age-conditioned 1- and 2-month weight gain increments. Plots of empirical densities showed that the distributions of the z-scores from the two methods overlap for each respective test interval (figures C1 and C2). Distributions of pairwise differences between the z-scores from the two methods were also examined (figures C3 and C4). Ninety percent of the differences were between -0.33 and +0.34 (for 1-month intervals) and between -0.27 and +0.29 (for 2-month intervals). To assess the magnitude of the impact of regression to the mean, two sets of children were selected: one in the lower bound (WA z-scores between -2.5 and -1.5) and the other in the upper bound (WA z-scores between +1.5 to +2.5) of attained growth at the start (time1) of specified intervals. The change in their z-scores at the end (time2) of 1- or 2-month periods were examined to observe what proportion deviated from the assumption of regression to the mean (Table C1). For the lower bound (time1 z-scores between -2.5 and -1.5), the results were consistent with regression to the mean only for initial ages 0-1 months and 0-2 months, i.e. WA drifted further from the median for 21% and 13% of children, respectively. For the remaining ages, 30-52% (1-month intervals) and 28-47% (2-month intervals) of weights shifted further from the mean, contrary to shifts that would have reflected regression to the mean. Similar findings were observed for the upper bound (time1 z- scores between +1.5 and +2.5) i.e. 27% (age 0-1 month) and 20% (age 0-2 months) drifted away from the mean. In the older age groups, this tendency was observed for 37-55% (1-month intervals) and 30-54% (2-month intervals). As expected, corresponding average changes in WA z-scores were, relatively high at ages 0-1 or 0-2 months (in the assumed direction of regression to the mean), but they dropped rapidly thereafter to near 0. In summary, growth in snapshots of 1- or 2-month intervals was consistent with regression to the mean between birth and 1 or 2 months but the phenomenon was much less evident at later ages. Differences between individual z-scores when applying the two methods were relatively minor. This',

      '2. METHODOLOGY 2.1 Design of the WHO Multicentre Growth Reference Study The MGRS (July 1997–December 2003) was a population-based study undertaken in Davis, California, USA; Muscat, Oman; Oslo, Norway; and Pelotas, Brazil; and in selected affluent neighbourhoods of Accra, Ghana and South Delhi, India. The MGRS protocol and its implementation in the six sites are described in detail elsewhere (de Onis et al., 2004a). Briefly, the MGRS combined a longitudinal component from birth to 24 months with a cross-sectional component of children aged 18–71 months. The longitudinal sample with visits planned at target ages allowed for the construction of growth velocity standards, which are the focus of this report. Mothers and newborns were screened and enrolled at birth and visited at home a total of 21 times on weeks 1, 2, 4 and 6; monthly from 2–12 months; and bimonthly in the second year. Data were collected on anthropometry, motor development, feeding practices, child morbidity, perinatal factors, and socioeconomic, demographic and environmental characteristics (de Onis et al., 2004b). The study populations lived in socioeconomic conditions favourable to growth where mobility was low, ≥20% of mothers followed WHO feeding recommendations and breastfeeding support was available (de Onis et al., 2004b). Individual inclusion criteria were: no known health or environmental constraints to growth; mothers willing to follow MGRS feeding recommendations (i.e. exclusive or predominant breastfeeding for at least 4 months, introduction of complementary foods by the age of 6 months, and continued partial breastfeeding up to at least 12 months); no maternal smoking before and after delivery; single term birth; and absence of significant morbidity (de Onis et al., 2004c). As part of the site-selection process in Ghana, India and Oman, surveys were conducted to identify socioeconomic characteristics that could be used to select groups whose growth was not environmentally constrained (Owusu et al., 2004; Bhandari et al., 2002; Mohamed et al., 2004). Local criteria for screening newborns, based on parental education and/or income levels, were developed from those surveys. Pre-existing survey data for this purpose were available from Brazil, Norway and the USA. The enrolment and baseline characteristics of the WHO Multicentre Growth Reference Study are described in detail elsewhere (WHO Multicentre Growth Reference Study Group, 2006c). Term low-birth-weight (<2500 g) infants (2.3%) were not excluded. Since it is likely that in well-off populations such infants represent small but normal children, their exclusion would have artificially distorted the standards’ lower centiles. 2.2 Anthropometry methods Data collection teams were trained at each site during the study\'s preparatory phase, at which time measurement techniques were standardized against one of two MGRS anthropometry experts. During the study, bimonthly standardization sessions were conducted at each site. Once a year, the anthropometry expert visited each site to participate in these sessions (de Onis et al., 2004c). Results from the anthropometry standardization sessions have been reported elsewhere (WHO Multicentre Growth Reference Study Group, 2006b). For the longitudinal component of the study, screening teams measured newborns within 24 hours of delivery, and follow-up teams conducted home visits until 24 months of age (de Onis et al., 2004b). The longitudinal component of the MGRS included data on weight, recumbent length (referred to subsequently as length) and head circumference, for which growth velocity standards are presented in this report. Observers working in pairs collected anthropometric data. Each observer independently measured and recorded a complete set of measurements, after which the two compared their readings. If any pair of readings exceeded the maximum allowable difference for a given variable (weight, 100 g; length, 7 mm; head circumference, 5 mm), both observers once again independently measured and recorded a second and, if necessary, a third set of readings for the variable(s) in question (de Onis et al., 2004b). - 5 -',
